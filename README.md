# Dynamic-Server-Allocation-and-Capacity-Analysis-in-a-Restaurant-Service-System
# Project Summary
Developed and implemented a simulation-based project to optimize restaurant service efficiency through dynamic server allocation. This project focused on enhancing customer experience by minimizing waiting times and balancing server workloads across three primary product categories: pizzas, dishes (main courses), and drinks. Leveraged a Flexible M/M/c Queuing System with Poisson arrival processes and exponential service times to simulate real-world demand scenarios and evaluate system performance under varying load conditions.
# Key Contributions and Achievements:
1. Dynamic Server Allocation: Designed an adaptable server reallocation strategy to switch servers between different tasks (e.g., pizza and dish preparation) based on real-time demand fluctuations, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
Simulation & Data Analysis: Conducted simulations for various load levels (50%, 75%, and 83%) over a 600-minute operational period to measure waiting times, sojourn times, and system performance.
2. Performance Optimization:
Optimized server configurations to handle underloaded and overloaded conditions effectively.
Evaluated the impact of server reallocation on customer wait times for pizzas and dishes, identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
3. Results-Driven Approach:
Achieved minimal sojourn and waiting times under moderate load conditions (50%-75%) by dynamically rebalancing server assignments.
Identified system limitations and proposed strategies for improved scalability under high-demand scenarios (83% load).
4. Quantitative Insights: Analyzed performance metrics such as load factor (œÅ), average sojourn times, and server utilization to guide decision-making for future restaurant capacity planning
# Tools & Technologies Used:
1. Programming: MATLAB (for simulation and modeling).
2. Queuing Theory: Applied M/M/c queuing models with dynamic server reallocation for real-time load balancing.
3. Data Analysis: Evaluated statistical measures such as sojourn times, waiting times, and load factors to assess system efficiency.
# Impact:
The project demonstrated how dynamic server reallocation can significantly improve customer service efficiency in a restaurant setting. The findings provide actionable insights for optimizing staffing and reducing bottlenecks, ensuring smooth operations even during peak demand periods.
